  Getting Started with Latex

<p>So I started writing a paper using Latex for the first time, and found it
pretty difficult to get started with. So here a quick guide on how to
get up and running with Latex on your local machine.</p>
<p>First, you need to install something that can work with Latex.
I'm on Arch Linux, so I just basically installed every texlive package listed
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/TeX_Live">here</a>. Then I downloaded a Latex template for
the journal I'm hoping to get my paper published in. I assume these are all similar.
You basically just want to edit the .tex file with Latex syntax. Then you run the command
<code>pdflatex [myfile].tex</code>, which produces a pdf file of the Latex output.</p>
<p>So obviously it's obviously really annoying to run this commnand everytime you want to see
the Latex output, so I made a quick script to run this command anytime the .tex file is edited:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-bash "><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#96b5b4;">echo </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">[</span><span>myfile</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">]</span><span>.tex | </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">entr</span><span> pdflatex </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">[</span><span>myfile</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">]</span><span>.tex
</span></code></pre>
<p>You probably need to install the <code>entr</code> package for this. But now you can just open the output
pdf file with a pdf viewer (I use <a href="https://help.gnome.org/users/evince/stable/">Evince</a>), run
the script, and the pdf should update in whenever you save. There's an lot of other weird things
to iron out when using Latex, but I think this is the most annoying one.</p>
